# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
I completed this prework to better familiarize and prepare myself for success in the upcoming bootcamp class.

This project grants me and anyone who wishes to utilize it helpful reference to commands and rules of coding for any future work.

This webpage will grant the user the perfect resource to succeed in the prework offered by the bootcamp for full stack web development.

At completion I learned how to familiarize myself with HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript well enough to feel confidence at the start date of my bootcamp program.

Each section contains notes and information about the four topics HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. One could also utilize the Google Chrome DevTools console and could see the Javascript running. This will allow you to chose which part of coding to study first.
